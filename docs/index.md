# NS3 - GUI Code Generator

## NS3 (Network Simulator 3)
- NS3, or **_Network Simulator 3_**, is an open-source discrete-event network simulator **developed primarily** for _research 
  and educational purposes._ 
- It is widely used in the field of **computer networking** to simulate and analyze the _behavior 
  of complex communication networks._ 
- NS3 allows researchers and developers to experiment with various network protocols, 
  applications, and scenarios in a controlled and repeatable environment

## GUI Code Generator
- In NS3, coding in C/C++ is a requirement for simulation tasks, which may pose a challenge for students or researchers
  who are relatively new to NS3 and still in the early stages of learning.
- To enhance code comprehension and expedite the learning process, I've developed an application that facilitates the generation of code for fundamental networking topologies.
